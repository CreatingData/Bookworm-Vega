This library is intended to replace the old Bookworm-D3 library. It
translates a variety of simple plot types from the old library into
Vega-Lite specs, and then embeds them on a target div.


It's still in a very early stage of development, but is suitable for
building a few visualizations. I also hope to make it embeddable in
observable notebooks pretty soon.

It should really be an ES6 module, but for now it's just a single
'index.js' file thaht you can import.
